1. Philip K. Dick's story "We Can Remember it For You Wholesale" ends with Quail learning that he 
prevented one of these events through "kindness and mercy" alone. This kind of event is facilitated with 
a technology called "sophons" in a novel in which "Wallbreakers" help carry it out. Cixin Liu's 
("tsuh-sheen lyoo'z") ​book ​The Dark Forest​ begins 400 years before this kind of event is planned to occur. In 
another novel, the narrator knocks out an annoying curate in the (*)​ aftermath of this kind of event. In that 
novel, a deadly weapon called "Black Smoke" and machines called tripods are used by a group carrying out this 
kind of event, but bacteria harmless to humans thwart that plan. For 10 points, give this kind of struggle shown 
in H.G. Wells's ​The War of the Worlds​. 
ANSWER: ​invasion of Earth​ [accept ​alien invasion​ or any answers indicating a ​conflict​ with ​alien​s and/or 
extraterrestrial​s; prompt on ​destruction of mankind​ or ​human genocide​ or equivalents; prompt on answers of

2. This city's rulers were charged with providing "care for all souls" in a proclamation by Zosimus the 
Bearded. Those rulers of this city adopted the double-headed eagle as a symbol after one of them married 
Sophia Palaiologina ​("pah-LIE-oh-loh-GHEE-nah")​, and crowned themselves with a golden cap supposedly 
awarded to their ancestors by Constantine Monomakh. The monk Philotheus ​("phi-loh-THAY-us") ​began the 
tradition of calling this city the (*)​ "Third Rome." By winning the Great Stand on the Ugra River, this city 
asserted its independence from the "Tatar Yoke" imposed by the Golden Horde. Under its Rurikid 
("RURR-ih-kid")​ rulers, this city replaced Constantinople as the focal point of Orthodox culture and housed such 
icon painters as Andrei Rublev. For 10 points, name this city which contains the Kremlin. 
ANSWER: ​Moscow​ [accept ​Moskva​ or ​Muscovy​] 
<Alston, History - European>  
 
3. One book by this philosopher divides science into the categories of "practical," "theoretical," and 
"productive." That book by this thinker includes "logical," "ontological," and "psychological" ways of 
stating the law of non-contradiction. In "Book Theta’ of that work by this philosopher, he distinguishes 
between a substance's possible modes of existence, or "potentiality," from its definite existence, or (*) 
"actuality." This philosopher proposed "material," "efficient," "final," and "formal" as the four types of causes 
in a book which studies "being qua being." This author of ​Metaphysics​ discussed logic in ​Prior Analytics​,

4. Due to its low atomic mass, beryllium is nearly transparent to this phenomenon, which allows it to 
serve as a "window". Spectroscopic techniques using this radiation cannot effectively detect the presence 
of hydrogen or helium. Manne Siegbahn introduced the notation used in spectroscopy based on this 
radiation, which includes the k alpha transition. ESCA uses this phenomenon to induce the (*) 
photoelectric effect. Because this radiation has wavelengths on the same scale as interatomic spacing, crystal 
lattices serve as effective diffraction gratings for it. Experiments with Crookes tubes resulted in Wilhelm 
Roentgen's discovery of this form of radiation. For 10 points name this ionizing radiation with energy higher 
than UV light and lower than gamma rays. 
ANSWER: ​x-ray​s [accept ​Röntgen​ radiation before he is mentioned]

5. Ashley Montagu called these concepts a "fallacy" in the book ​Man's Most Dangerous Myth​, and he 
helped UNESCO issue a 1950 statement that treated these concepts scientifically. Johann Blumenbach 
proposed five of these concepts, and subscribed to the "degenerist" view that these concepts can be 
traced back to Adam and Eve. Samuel Morton used craniometric skull measurements to create these 
constructs, to support his (*)​ polygenist account of the origin of these groups. Historical examples of these 
groupings include Caucasoid, Mongoloid, and Negroid; in the modern era police officers often create "profiles" 
based on these constructs. For 10 points, name these sociological groupings of humans into categories, such as 
"black" or "white" people.

<Bentley, Geography - Europe>  
 
7. This work concludes with the speaker telling readers that they are "grossly mistaken" if they think she 
can recollect any of the "hodge-podge medley of speech" she has just spoken. This essay praises bees and 
their "inimitable combs" for their "industry" despite being "Nature's dumb creatures." Much of this 
essay attacks "long-robed philosophers," "artisans," and priests, and describes how the title character is 
served by Laziness, Forgetfulness, and Self-Love. This (*)​ ​encomium​ is often published with the illustrations 
of Hans Holbein, and is named for a goddess who is the daughter of Youth and Plutus laughing at the stupidity 
of the world. Thomas More is the dedicatee of, for 10 points, what essay by Desiderius Erasmus that venerates

8. In 1905, a jury in this state refused to convict a man who admitted to shooting Guy Bradley, a game 
warden tasked with single-handedly protecting this state's birds from poachers. Dixie Highway booster 
Carl G. Fisher put up a billboard in Times Square boasting that it was "June" in this state during a 
1920s land bubble ended by the sinking of the ​Prinz Valdemar​. In that same decade, a white mob 
destroyed Rosewood, which, like (*)​ Eatonville, was an all-black community in this state. In 1992, this state 
was the first in the contiguous US where the Category 5 Hurricane Andrew made landfall. Henry Flagler built a 
railroad to an island off this state's coast sometimes called the Conch Republic. For 10 points, name this state

one in Caravaggio's ​Entombment of Christ​ and is found next to an object whose handle was changed from 
white to black. Having seen the actual scene of this painting, the artist added such details as a green rug 
and a vinegar-soaked cloth wrapped around its subject's (*)​ head. The artist's signature is found on a block 
of wood in this painting next to the title figure's slumped arm, which holds a fountain pen. A bloody letter from 
Charlotte Corday is shown in, for 10 points, what Jacques-Louis David painting of an assassinated French

10. The formula for the grand potential reduces to this equation if the log Z term equals particle number. 
This equation is true if, at constant temperature, entropy scales linearly with the log of volume. If this 
equation is true, then all the departure and residual functions are zero, and the enthalpy depends only on 
temperature. This equation is generally a decent approximation if the specific volume is greater than (*) 
5 liters per mole. This equation is equivalent to setting the compressibility factor to one or when the a and b 
parameters are zero in the van der Waals equation. A constant found in this equation is approximately 8.314 
joules per mole kelvin. For 10 points, name this equation of state used for gases at low pressures and high 
temperatures that equates PV to nRT. 
ANSWER: ​ideal gas​ law

and fond of a guinea." Another author with this surname edited a poetry magazine whose title alludes to 
the concept that human imagination contains "The Germ" of an idea. This family included William 
Michael, as well as an author who wrote of two women telling each other "Come and kiss me. / Never 
mind my bruises, / Hug me, kiss me, suck my juices." The poem (*)​ "Jenny" was written by an author of this 
family who wrote a poem in which the title figures state "Come buy, come buy" to Laura, who gives a lock of

12. Lysine and arginine residues in collagen and crystallin may cross-link by reacting with this 
compound, which forms the most common AGE ​(A-G-E)​. Gliflozins inhibit the function of a 
sodium/potassium pump-powered transporter of this compound found in the kidney. A roughly 
three-month average for plasma concentration of this compound can be obtained by measuring 
hemoglobin (*)​ A1c levels. Three equivalents of this molecule are transferred from a chain by debranching 
enzyme. Amylin lowers blood levels of this compound, as does the drug metformin. Cellular absorption of this 
typical substrate of hexokinase is promoted by hormones produced by the pancreatic beta cells. For 10 points

ANSWER: D-​glucose​ [accept ​dextrose​] 
<Wang, Science - Biology>  
 
13. This man's son Amphictyon ​("am-FIK-tee-un")​ was supposedly the first person to learn to mix wine with 
water. This king ended a conflict by sacrificing to Zeus at a seaweed-covered shrine near the river 
Cephissus. On the advice of his father, this king of Phthia ​("F'THEE-ah")​ began a construction project 
shortly after after a god drank a soup made from lamb, goat, and the the flesh of Nyctimus ​(NIK-tim-uss)​, 
who was a son of the impious ​("im-PIE-us")​ Arcadian king Lycaon ​("lie-KAY-on")​. After reaching a (*) 
mountain often identified as Athos or Orthrys, he visited an oracle of Themis who told him to throw the "bones 
of his mother" over his shoulder, which he and his wife realized referred to rocks. For 10 points, name this son 
of Prometheus who repopulated the earth after surviving a flood with his wife Pyrrha ​("PEER-ah")​.

14. In the aftermath of this event, an oval-shaped "oculus" designed to resemble a bird leaving the hands 
of a child was built for a transportation hub designed by Santiago Calatrava. The firm Davis Brody Bond 
designed an underground museum to this event, and is reached by a large glass-enclosed pavilion made 
by the Norwegian firm Snohetta. This event, which resulted in the destruction of a complex designed by 
Minoru (*)​ Yamasaki, led to the creation of a new set of buildings designed by Daniel Libeskind 
("LEE-bus-kihnd")​, the tallest of which is exactly 1,776 feet high. The art installation ​Tribute In Light​, in which 88 
searchlights project two light beams into the air, commemorates the destruction of the World Trade Center

15. Islamic scholars often divide the world into a "House of Islam" or Dar al-Islam, the Dar al-'Ahd, and 
a third "Dar" named for this concept. Elias Canetti's ​Crowds and Power​ asserts that Islam exhibits the 
"unmistakable traits" of a "religion of" this concept. Christian ethics of this concept's legitimacy, as 
outlined by Hugo Grotius and Thomas Aquinas, are often compared to a passage from the "Cow" sura 
about (*)​ "transgressors." A passage from Isaiah 2:4 about "pruning hooks" and "plowshares" states that nations 
shall not "train for" this concept any more. The righteousness of this concept is assessed by St. Augustine's 
"just" theory of it. For 10 points, ​jihad​ "by the sword" is often described as a "holy" form of what concept? 
ANSWER: ​war​ [accept ​holy war​; accept ​qital​ or ​harb​ or Dar al-​Harb​; accept ​fight​ing or ​killing​ before "train

<Jose, Literature - American>  
 
17. Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe, who has written extensively on these "ancient" people, argues in his 
book ​Facing the Ocean​ that they grew out of maritime interaction in the Bronze Age, as opposed to from 
the continental Hallstatt ​("HALL-shtaht")​ culture. The Spanish region of Galicia asserts that it should be a 
member of a six-nation league named for these people. The La Tène ​("lah TEN")​ culture was created by 
these people, whose namesake "fringe" includes the regions of (*)​ Cornwall and Brittany. A 19th-century 
revival of the culture of these people promoted insular art styles, such as their namesake "cross," as well as the

which turned out to have been caused by a rare "twisting-mode" degree of freedom induced from 
aeroelastic flutter. The engineer Heinrich Gerber patented several ways of constructing these things, 
including one using hinges to create (*)​ cantilevers on them, It was commonly thought that wind-induced 
resonance destroyed the Tacoma Narrows one of these things in 1942. A simple one of these structures may 
consist of a girder, to which a truss may be added to prevent buckling from compression. For 10 points, name 
these structures that are often built over rivers.

19. This composer considered using the label "symphony-grotesque" for the Symphony No. 1 in F minor 
he completed at age 19. This composer's friends in the Beethoven Quartet asked him to write a quartet 
with a piano part so that he could travel with them, resulting in his Piano Quintet in G minor. The 
Beethoven Quartet also premiered all but two of this man's fifteen string quartets, including his (*) 
eighth, which uses his monogram "D, E-flat, C, B" and is dedicated to "victims of fascism and war." After being 
rebuked for "formalist" tendencies by an article in ​Pravda​, this composer wrote his Symphony No. 5 in 
response to "justified criticism" of his opera ​Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk​. For 10 points, name this Soviet 
composer of the "Leningrad" symphony.

20. This body of water's basin was home to a religious complex called the Yaya-Mama culture. Johan 
Reinhard found an underwater temple in this body, which was probably built by the same culture that 
built the "Gate of the Sun" just south of it at Tiwanaku ​("tee-wah-NAH-koo")​. Natives who lived near this 
body of water helped build Thor Heyerdahl's ​("HIGH-er-doll'z")​ ​Kon-Tiki​ raft, which was modeled on 
traditional reed boats used to cross it. Raised-field agriculture was developed to exploit this body of water 
by local (*)​ Aymara people. This body, the largest in the Altiplano, is inhabited by many Quechua 
("KETCH-wah")​ speakers who moved here during Inca times. The highest navigable major lake in the world is, for

21. The poet Stesichorus ​("steh-SIK-ur-us")​ was supposedly blinded for criticizing, then unblinded for 
writing an encomium about, this figure. Herodotus interviewed priests in the temple of "Foreign 
Aphrodite" who said that a king named Proteus sequestered this figure. Polydamna gave the drug 
nepenthe​ ​("neh-PEN-thay")​ to this person, who in some stories feigns Bacchic rites in order to use a torch as 
a signal. A sword belonging to Deiphobus ​("day-FOH-bus")​ is hidden by this woman, who in some stories is 
(*)​ replaced by an ​eidolon​ ​("eye-DOH-lun")​ made of clouds and spends ten years in Egypt. The Oath of Tyndareus 
("tin-DARE-ee-us")​ was sworn by the suitors of this woman, who accordingly join in a conflict sparked when she
